handlebars example for dashboard template 


dashboard  handlebars page needs the styling and html in it , and will have a script will have 
js file responsible for functionality linked 

js file , will have a line that if status = 200 it will have document.location /dashboard 

internally this means lh:3000/dashboard (html route) and whatever the html route does , 
if it sends us back to the dashboard it will redirect to the dashboard
